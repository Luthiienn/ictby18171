      <p>Does your organisation store confidential data? Does it deal with personally identifiable information to conduct business operations? Do you need financial data in order to transact? The obvious answer to these questions is, “yes.”
        Organisations today, have information. Lots of it, in fact. Varied formats of information. Organisations transact with this information. They store this information. Quite often the information does not belong to the company; it belongs to third parties (such as customers, business partners, suppliers etc).
        Businesses are beginning to realise that having information, especially sensitive third-party information, makes them a target. News headlines remind us daily: cyber-attacks are growing. Cyber threats are increasing in frequency, prominence and severity. Organisational reputation and the business itself are faced with constant risk.

      <h4><strong>Cybersecurity Workplace Culture</strong> </br>A cybersecurity workplace culture is a culture where security is ingrained and infused in every aspect of the workplace. It is built into the thinking and planning. It is included in the application, systems and processes. It is a part and parcel of how work is done. Thereby, minimising the chances of a cyber-attack. A strong cybersecurity posture is heavily reliant on an organisation’s culture. Building a cybersecurity workplace culture not only emphasises and reinforces security behaviours among staff but it also helps to protect your organisation against a cyber-attack.</h4><br>
      <p><strong>Designing and building cybersecurity workplace culture</strong> </br> 
        Establishing a cybersecurity workplace culture, while widely considered to be a tough mission to accomplish, is not as daunting as you may think.
Consider a few elements, the first of which is the attitude. The attitude towards cybersecurity, including how the management implements cybersecurity while ensuring educational and communication plans are in place; all contribute to successfully building a cybersecurity workplace culture:

    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      Referred to as information security, cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, 
      and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, 
      technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access.

          <div class="panel-body">The world relies on technology more than ever before. As a result, digital data creation has surged. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an organization.
            A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. It can unravel a company’s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust. The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company its competitive advantage. Going further, a data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. It’s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines, it’s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.

                    Social engineering is a type of manipulation that coaxes someone into giving up confidential information such as a social security number or building access codes. Social engineering, in the world of information security, is a type of cyber-attack that works to get the better of people through trickery and deception rather than technological exploits. These attacks take advantage of human vulnerabilities such as emotions, trust or habit in order to convince individuals to take action such as clicking a fraudulent link or visiting a malicious website. Though less sophisticated than other cyber-attack strategies, social engineering can have severe consequences and often can be the attacker's foot in the door for a major attack.

  <h2>Data Breach</h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    A data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. 
    Data breaches can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways. 
    They are a costly expense that can damage lives and reputations and take time to repair.   
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    As technology progresses, more and more of our information has been moving to the digital world. 
    As a result, cyberattacks have become increasingly common and costly.
    We’ve created a 7-step checklist to use in the case of a data breach. Depending on the severity of the breach and the information exposed, 
    you’ll need to apply some or all of these steps to varying degree.  <b>Seven Step Checklist</b>
  </p> 
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#home">1. Confirm the breach if your information was exposed</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu1">2. Find out what type of data was stolen</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu2">3. Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu3">4. Strengthen your online logins, passwords and security</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu4">5. Contact the right people and take additional action</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu5">6. Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely</a></li>

  <div class="tab-content" style="background-color: #eee; padding: 40px; height: 300px;">
    <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <h3>Confirm the breach and if your information was exposed</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to confirm that a breach actually occurred. 
        When a data breach occurs, scammers may reach out to you posing as the breached company to try to obtain more of your personal information. Don't fall for fake emails. Go to the company's secure website and/or 
        call the company to confirm the breach and whether your information was involved.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Find out what type of data was stolen</h3>
      <p>
        Why does the type of information exposed matter? 
        While stolen credit cards and the like can be cancelled and replaced, it's quite difficult to obtain a new Social Security number. And fraudsters can do a lot more with your SSN and other unique, 
        sensitive PII than they can accomplish with an email or credit card account.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help</h3>
      <p>
        If the breached company offers to help repair the damage and protect you for a certain amount of time, unless there have been issues with their offer, take them up on it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Change Password and Security Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        It's important to immediately change your online login information, passwords, and security questions-and-answers for the breached account(s)—along with your other accounts if they have similar passwords and security Q&A—to limit the reach of the hackers' arms. This step was especially important for victims with stolen email accounts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Contact the right people to tack action</h3>
      <p>This is where the type of data stolen really comes into play. 
        If your credit and/or debit card information was stolen, you should reach out immediately to the financial institution(s) to cancel your card and request a new one. However, if personal information like your Social Security number was stolen, 
        it may be easier for you to become a victim of identity theft.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3>Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely</h3>
        <p>
            It's important to watch for signs of new activity. In cases where Social Security numbers were stolen, the hackers and others who put their hands on the numbers may use them now or wait years when victims may be less suspecting.

  <h2>Project Teams</h2>
  <p>A project team can be defined as a number of people who work closely together to achieve shared common goals. Through interaction and collaboration, the team strives to enhance its creativity, innovation, problem solving, decision making, support and work performance.
    From the definitions, a team implies a number of people working together to achieve results, while a group of people (in project management speak) implies a collection of individuals who, although they might be working on the same project, do not necessarily interact with each other. This is often the case when the project manager coordinates the project with the people individually. Under such conditions, unity of project purpose is a myth.</p>
